# Graduate_Admissions_Analysis

First Commit :clap: :clap: :clap:
This is a simple MATLAB code for finding the chance that a graduate can be admitted using linear regression.

## Descriptions

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters included are (in order):
* GRE Scores (out of 34)
* TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
* University Rating (out of 5)
* Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
* Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
* Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
* Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)

Output
* Admission Chance (ranging from 0 to 1)

```
Chance of Admission (Research = 1): 0.795982
Chance of Admission (Research = 0): 0.637680
Average number of recommendation letters: 3.484000
